## Offscreen content is not hidden from assistive technology
Manual Test: Offscreen content is hidden from assistive technology

Description:<br>
Offscreen content is hidden with display: none or aria-hidden=true. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/how-to-review#try_it_with_a_screen_reader).

### Main navigation is not keyboard or screen reader accessible [Priority]

Issues: 1. The main menu hamburger button is not focusable because `<a>` elements with no `href` attribute cannot receive focus.  2. When a screen reader comes across this link it will only say "nav". Since this is the only way to navigate the website, we should add some screen reader only text to clearly indicate that this is the main menu. 3. When a user tabs through the website, the keyboard focus indicator gets lost inside the the off-screen main menu.

__Visual location:__

![busted hamburger](assets/offscreen--main-nav-hamberger.png)

__HTML location:__

```html
<a id="navtoggle">
  <span class="n">n</span>
  <span class="a">a</span>
  <span class="v">v</span>
</a>
```

#### Suggested solution:

Truly hide the menu when it is intended to be off-screen. Add correct ARIA attributes and states. Make the toggle button keyboard and screen reader focusable.

Just paste this in the JS anywhere after the menu is initialized:

```js

var $navToggle = jQuery('#navtoggle');
var $navContent = jQuery('#primary-nav > div');

$navToggle.prepend('<span class="element-invisible">Main menu toggle</span>');
$navContent.hide();

$navToggle.attr({
    'href': '#',
    'aria-expanded': 'false',
    'aria-haspopup': 'true',
    'aria-label': 'toggle main navigation'
});

$navToggle.on('click', function() {
    if (jQuery('html').hasClass('nav-open')) {
        jQuery(this).attr('aria-expanded','true');
        $navContent.show();
    } else {
        jQuery(this).attr('aria-expanded','false');
        $navContent.hide();
    }
});
```

Optionally, the hamburger could start with the prepended html and the ARIA attributes indicated with the JS above.

## Buttons do not have an accessible name

When a button doesn't have an accessible name, screen readers announce it as "button", making it unusable for users who rely on screen readers. [Learn more](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/2.2/button-name?application=lighthouse).


### The Search `button` has no `value` attribute and it contains no inner text to indicate its purpose [Priority]

__Visual location:__


![button is not descriptive](assets/button-name--search.png)

#### HTML location:

```html
<button type="submit" class="button-submit">
  <svg>
    <path></path>
  </svg>
</button>
```

#### Suggested solution:

There are many simple ways to fix this issue. Choose one of the following:

__Option 1:__

Add `value="search"` to the button element.

```html
<button type="submit" class="button-submit" value="Search">
  <svg>
    <path></path>
  </svg>
</button>
```


Note: It _must_ be the first child of itâ€™s parent element.

__Option 2:__

Add screen reader only text `<span class="element-invisible">Search</span>`:

```html
<button type="submit" class="button-submit">
+  <span class="element-invisible">Search</span>
  <svg>
    <path></path>
  </svg>
</button>
```

## Headings don't skip levels
Manual Test: Headings don&#39;t skip levels

Description:<br>
Headings are used to create an outline for the page and heading levels are not skipped. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/how-to-review#take_advantage_of_headings_and_landmarks).

### Missing `<h1>`
Pages should have one `<h1>` for accessibility, it also helps with search engine optimization if the `<h1>` has text in it. 

Change `<div id="logo">` to `<h1 id="logo">`.

the `<h1>` will cause an unwanted margin below the logo. I suggest adding `margin: 0` to the `#logo` so it looks the same as when we started.

The website could just wrap the logo in an `<h1>` instead.

Everything else looks good!

## Links do not have a discernible name [Priority]

Link text (and alternate text for images, when used as links) that is discernible, unique, and focusable improves the navigation experience for screen reader users. [Learn more](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/2.2/link-name?application=lighthouse).



### The logo `<a>` link has no text inside.

__Visual location:__


![ link that is not descriptive](assets/link--logo-no-text.png)

__HTML Location__:

```html
<a href="/" class="logo-link">
```

Empty links are not read to a screen reader user, as a result, they will no know what the link does or where it would take them.

#### Suggested solution:

Add screen reader only text inside link.

```html
<a href="/" class="logo-link">
  <span class="desktop-only">
    <svg viewBox="0 0 697 67"></svg>
  </span>
  <span class="element-invisible">Duke Health Graduate Medical Education</span>

## HTML5 landmark elements are used to improve navigation
Manual Test: HTML5 landmark elements are used to improve navigation

Description:<br>
Landmark elements (&lt;main&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, etc.) are used to improve the keyboard navigation of the page for assistive technology. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/how-to-review#take_advantage_of_headings_and_landmarks).

### Missing `<main>` element

The website has a `<header>` and a `<footer>`.  We just need to add a `<main>` element.  It allows the screen reader user to skip to the main content area.

#### Suggested Solution:

Wrap the `<section>` elements in one `<main>` element.

```html 
+ <main>
  	<div class="bound-layout"></div>
  	<section class="home-intro"></section>
  	<section class="home-content"></section>
  	<section class="module module-image-banner module-image-banner-left" style="background-image: url(https://gme.duke.edu/sites/gme.duke.edu/files/styles/masthead/public/life-in-durham-2.jpg?itok=uHEngSP5);"></section>

## Form elements do not have associated labels 

Labels ensure that form controls are announced properly by assistive technologies, like screen readers. [Learn more](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/2.2/label?application=lighthouse).

__Visual location:__

![ form element with no label](assets/label--search-element-missing-label.png)

__HTML location:__

```html
<input type="search" name="keyword" class="input-search" placeholder="Search">
```

#### Suggested solution:
Add `<label for="something">` to associate the label with that form field. If the element does not have and ID attribute to associate add `id="something"`.
If you wish to visually hide the label add class `.element-invisible` to the `<label>`.

## `[user-scalable="no"]` is used in the `<meta name="viewport">` element or the `[maximum-scale]` attribute is less than 5.

Disabling zooming is problematic for users with low vision who rely on screen magnification to properly see the contents of a web page. [Learn more](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/2.2/meta-viewport?application=lighthouse).


__HTML location:__

```html
<meta name="viewport" id="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,initial-scale=1.0">
```

#### Suggested Solution:

Option 1:

In Drupal this can also be done in the template.php file with something similar to this (â€˜alpha-viewportâ€™ $head_element name varies depending on the base theme):

<pre>
$head_elements['alpha-viewport'] = array(
  '#type' => 'html_tag',
  '#tag' => 'meta',
  '#attributes' => array(
    'name' => 'viewport',
    'content' => 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes',
  ),
);
</pre>

Option 2:

Go into the html.tpl.php file and change it there.

Changing the maximum scale to 5 will allow people to scale the page. Depending on how the website is styled, it could cause unexpected issues with the mobile view of the site getting a horizontal scrollbar. It is worth testing to ensure that does not happen.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5" user-scalable="yes">
```

## Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.

Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read. [Learn more](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/2.2/color-contrast?application=lighthouse).



### The element  _"n"_, _"a"_, _"v"_ has low contrast.

This is a false positive, but false positives have been used in litigation to support claims of inaccessible websites, because lawyers don't understand this stuff. So, we must fix it anyway.

__Visual location:__


![a text with low contrast](assets/offscreen--main-nav-hamberger.png)

__HTML location:__

```html
<a id="navtoggle">
  <span class="n">n</span>
  <span class="a">a</span>
  <span class="v">v</span>
</a>
```

#### Suggested solution:

  Element has insufficient color contrast of 1.14 (foreground color: #00539b, background color: #494a4d, font size: 0.0pt, font weight: normal). Expected contrast ratio of 4.5:1

Add `color` to existing selector:

```css
#navtoggle > span {
+  color: #fff;
 display: block;
 ...
}
```

Visually, it will be the same, but it will not throw the error anymore.

## The user's focus is directed to new content added to the page
Manual Test: The user&#39;s focus is directed to new content added to the page

Description:<br>
If new content, such as a dialog, is added to the page, the user&#39;s focus is directed to it. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/how-to-review#start_with_the_keyboard).

### Main menu 
Does not indicate that new content is added to the screen, but this will be fixed by the task "Main navigation is not keyboard or screen reader accessible" above.

### Image caption hover states (x3)

__Visual location:__

![hover caption](assets/new-content--image-mouse-over.png)

__HTML location:__

```html
<div class="home-image home-image-3" style="background-image: url(https://gme.duke.edu/sites/gme.duke.edu/files/styles/home_big/public/henry-doshi-md2.jpg?itok=0fnQYg1X);">
  <div class="caption">
    Brandon Henry, M.D., M.P.H. Vascular Surgery Fellow, &amp; Anushree Doshi, M.D., Anesthesiology Resident
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Suggested solution:

I'm not sure what to do with this. Its technically a violation, but any fix we do on it would cause other accessibility problems, so ideally it should not be hidden, but its a low priority issue.


### Image caption low contrast (x3) [Priority]

There is also a contrast issue on the text here. It is illegible.

__Visual location:__

![low contrast overlay](assets/new-content--color-contrast-low.png)

#### Suggested solution:

Add `text-shadow` to existing selector.

```css
.home-intro .home-image .caption {
+  text-shadow: 1px 0px 1px #000, 1px 1px 3px #000, -1px -1px 4px #000, 0px 0px 8px #000;
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  z-index: 9;
  ...
}
```

That contrast fix makes the faux hidden text visible when it was 'hidden'. So we need to hide the overflow `overflow`.

Add `overflow: hidden` to new selector.

```css
.home-intro .home-image {
+  overflow: hidden;
}
```

Result:

![fixed color contrast](assets/new-content--color-contrast-fix.png)

### "Learn more" is not descriptive link text [priority] 

Link text with the words "Learn more" is not descriptive. The screen reader will read _"Learn more"_ to screen reader users. As a result, they will not know what the link does or where it will take them.

__HTML location:__

```html
<a href="/about/directors-welcome" class="btn bigger">
  Learn More
</a>
```

__Visual location:__

![learn more not good link text](assets/descriptive--learn-more-1.png)

#### Suggested solution:
Or add [screen reader only text](https://accessible360.com/accessible360-blog/use-aria-label-screen-reader-text/) inside the link.

Example:

```html
<a href="/about/directors-welcome" class="btn bigger">
  Learn More
  <span class="element-invisible"> about G M E</span>
</a>
```

<br>

__IMPORTANT NOTE: This rule applies to every "Learn more" link on the website.__

This is a major issue when outside entities audit our websites for compliance. They catch it every time.
